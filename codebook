Data frame variables have their names taken from the "features.txt" file that comes with the dataset.  
See the dataset documentation files for detailed discusion of measured variables.

Two additional variables are added to the data frame.

"Subject" serves as an index to which of the 30 subjects each observation corresponds to.
"Activity" likewise indexes which of the six activity types is associated with each observation.

The "tidy" data frame subset created for this assignment was output to tidy.txt using the write.table function.
